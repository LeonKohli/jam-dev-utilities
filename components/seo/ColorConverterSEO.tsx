        <h2>Understanding Color Conversions</h2>
        <p>
          Color conversions are essential for web developers, designers, and digital artists working across different platforms and mediums. Our tool supports five major color formats:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HEX: Used in HTML and CSS, e.g., #FF0000 for red</li>
          <li>RGB: Common in digital displays, e.g., rgb(255, 0, 0) for red</li>
          <li>HSL: Intuitive for adjusting hue, saturation, and lightness, e.g., hsl(0, 100%, 50%) for red</li>
          <li>HSV: Similar to HSL, but uses value instead of lightness, e.g., hsv(0, 100%, 100%) for red</li>
          <li>CMYK: Used in print design, e.g., cmyk(0%, 100%, 100%, 0%) for red</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Converting between these formats is crucial for accurately matching colors across different design tools, coding environments, and print media.
